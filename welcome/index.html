        <h3>What is HomeSafe?</h3>
        <p>
            HomeSafe is the best way you have of mitigating dangers of walking alone at night. It offers a quick, intuitive, and reliable way of automatically notifying others if you are in danger. 
        </p>


        <h3>Download</h3>

        <h3>High-Level Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Using HomeSafe is similar to using a countdown timer. Set an expected trip time, and start walking home. If you don't make it home on time, HomeSafe will prompt you for a passcode. Failing to enter this passcode in time will alert your emergency contacts that you might be in trouble.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Use</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>For first time users:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set up Homessafe by inputing user name, password, custom message, etc.</li>
                    <li>Enter your emergency contacts' information (email, phone number, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Choose which tier of emergency each contact belongs to (HomeSafe will wait longer before alerting higher tier contacts).</li>
                    <li>Choose a few common destinations you might have in the future for easy selection.</li>
                    <li>All of these settings can be changed later if you want.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Press 'Start Trip' and choose a destination from your favorite locations or map.</li>
                <li>Confirm the system-suggested trip time or enter your own.</li>
                <li>When the timer runs out, enter your passcode and indicate if you need more time.</li>
                <li>If you don't need more time, then simply choose to stop tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> You must explicitly stop HomeSafe tracking. If you leave your phone alone and allow the timer to elapse then your emergency contacts will be notified.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

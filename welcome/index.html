        <h3>What is HomeSafe?</h3>
        <p>
            TODO: A description of your project, such as what it does, what is unique about it, and why a user would want to use it.
        </p>


        <h3>Download</h3>
        <p>
            Get the <a href="#">HomeSafe APK</a> and install it on your phone.
        </p>

        <h3>High-Level Overview</h3>
        <p>
            TODO:  A high-level description of the user view of your software. Questions you might answer include the following. What is the concept around which the UI or user experience is organized (example: a canvas) and the way in which the user interacts or performs specific actions? Is the software designed by analogy to some other software, or to some process in the real world? Are there modes? What is the workflow?

            For some software, this section may be short. The more powerful your software (and the more it is aimed at sophisticated users), the greater the need for an overview of its operation and scope. Online help is very useful, but it is no substitute for an explanation of your product's concepts from the point of view of a user! 
        </p>

        <h3>How to Use</h3>
        <p>
            TODO: We should not get too detailed, but we should be clear.
